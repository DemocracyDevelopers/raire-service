/**
 * RAIRE (raire-java) generates a set of assertions for a given IRV contest. The different types of
 * assertion that RAIRE can generate are defined as subclasses of this base Assertion class. For a
 * description of what assertions are and the role they play in an IRV audit, see the Guide to
 * RAIRE. This class has ReadOnlyProperty annotations against attributes as raire-service creates
 * assertions to be stored in the database, but never modified existing assertions that are present
 * in the database. The only type of 'modification' that the raire-service will do, if required,
 * is delete assertions from the database for a specific contest, re-generate them, and store
 * the new assertions in the database.
 * The class is sealed so that other parts of the codebase can depend on there being only those
 * particular two kinds of assertion (NEN and NEB).
