 * Request (expected to be json) identifying the contest for which assertions should be retrieved
 * from the database (expected to be exported as json).
 * This extends ContestRequest and uses the contest name, totalAuditable ballots and candidate list,
 * plus validations, from there. The time limit is set to a default and ignored.
 * A GetAssertionsRequest identifies a contest by name along with the candidate list
 * (which is necessary for producing the metadata for later visualization). riskLimit states the
 * risk limit for the audit. This is not actually used in raire-service computations,
 * but will be output later with the assertion export, so that it can be used in the assertion
 * visualizer. Validation consists only of checking that the request is reasonable, including calling
 * ContestRequest.Validate to check that the contest exists and is all IRV, and that the candidate
 * names are reasonable. GetAssertionsRequest.Validate then checks that the risk limit is non-negative.
